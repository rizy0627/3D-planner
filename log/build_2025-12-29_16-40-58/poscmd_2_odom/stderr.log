CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:38 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target poscmd_2_odom because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libpython3.10.so.1.0] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/rizy/anaconda3/envs/myenv/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
